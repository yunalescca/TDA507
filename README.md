# Computational methods in bioinformatics

Throughout these assignments we have been working with data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB): https://www.rcsb.org/

### Assignment 1
A global and local sequence alignment program for amino acids.

### Assignment 2
Domain assignment exercise by studying the distance between alpha carbons in a PDB file. 

### Assignment 3
Exercise in finding the main chain trace in a simple text file (this has not been applied on PDB files).

### Assignment 4
Omitted as this was a study of a scientific topic. 

### Assignment 5
Given two PDB files, calculate which atoms in the second file that overlaps with at least one other atom in the first file.
